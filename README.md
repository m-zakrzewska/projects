# Repository in progress

This repository shows a few projects I made to show (more or less) what I know.

It is split in 3 "libraries":
* Python,
* R,
* PowerBI.

There will be multiple projects I did during my academic journey and after work projects.

## R 

1. Clusterization and classification on hepatitis dataset:

The report in html (made in *RMarkdown*) shows little data exploration, clusterization with PAM, DIANA, AGNES and K-prototypes methods and classification if the patiend died/lived by Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and Decision Trees. 

## Python

Will be updated

## PowerBI

1. Dashboard of the sales in the electronics company *This dashboard was mady for a data challenge*

The goal of the dashoard was staying up to date with the sales performance of each store, including sales and profits. It was also made to drill down into sales and profits of different products, stores, and combinations.


# More projects incoming!
